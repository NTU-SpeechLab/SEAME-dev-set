# SEAME-dev-set

For performance evaluation, we extract two subsets of the SEAME data as test sets: one is dominated by Mandarin speech (denoted as dev_man) while the other (denoted as dev_sge) is dominated by Singapore English. Each test set contains 10 speakers with balanced genders.

|           | Speakers  | hours  |
|-----------|:----:|:----:|
| train | 134 | 101.13 |
| dev_man| 10 | 7.49 |
| dev_sge | 10 | 3.93  |

We only shared the train wav file list which you can see in LDC2015S04.
